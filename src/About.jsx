                    <p>
                        I'm a 3rd year student at PUT in Pozna≈Ñ. My interests include microcontrollers etc.
                        Me and my friend even constructed a working line follower robot with our own PCB using Atmega8 once
                        - I can provide videos if requested.
                        I also constructed a breathalyzer with a small for IoT service attached (will provide videos if requested).
                        I meddle in C if needed, know a little bit of statistics and data analysis - Pandas included, can perform
                        rudimentary operations in IOS for Cisco devices, would settle to work with most technologies.
                        I know some Java - enough to build basic backends with Spring.
